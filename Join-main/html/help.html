                <b class="structure-title">Exploring the Board</b><br />
                When you log in to <a href="#">Join</a>, you'll find a default
                board. This board represents your project and contains four
                default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
                "Done".
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="structure">

                <b class="structure-title">Creating Contacts</b><br />
                In <a href="#">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on
                your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New
                contact", and fill in the required information. Once added,
                these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with
                the tasks on the board.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="structure">

                <b class="structure-title">Adding Cards</b><br />
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                etc.
              </p>

                <b class="structure-title">Moving Cards</b><br />
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                list to another.

                <b class="structure-title">Deleting Cards</b><br />
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                this action is irreversible.<br />
